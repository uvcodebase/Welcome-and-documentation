# UV Codebase
-----------------------------------
##Briefly - What is UV Codebase ?

It's a group gathering around the common purpose of coding (or programming). There is a focus on sharing tips and tricks, learning by doing, and contributing to the free software community.

---------------------------
##Purpose of this document

This is a set of guidelines to provide structure to meetings and help make sure everyone has fun. The purpose of these meetings are to:

* Provide enjoyable social interactions
* Provide enjoyable activities
* Foster collaborations 
* Provide volunteer opportunities
* Bring together community members around:
    * Learning to code
    * Learning how to code better
    * Working collaboratively
    * Shared goals
    * Free Software


-------------------------
##Meeting Details

**Specific Details**: See the [Wiki](https://github.com/uvcodebase/docs/wiki)

### When : 6pm - 8pm on a weeknight

At least once a month, 6pm - 8pm on a weeknight. 

Check the [Howe library events schedule](http://www.thehowe.org/right.php/pid/2/sid/1) for the exact days, as the day and room may shift depending on availability of meeting places. 

### Where : Howe Library

One of the [Howe library](http://www.thehowe.org) meeting rooms. For the exact location, again check the [Howe library events schedule](http://www.thehowe.org/right.php/pid/2/sid/1).

### What : Activities

Depending on the size of the group, there are multiple potential activities:

* Solving this meeting's programming challenge
* Helping newer programmers get started
* Learning a new tool
* Collaboration on a free software project

The Meeting Organizer will normally be available to help people get set up with a programming environment, and field general questions.

At each meeting, the Organizer will provide a programming challenge question for some participants to work on during the meeting, if they want. At the end of the meeting, a friendly competition for participants who want to submit their solutions will be held, and a challenge winner will be declared. 

Other meeting attenders can choose to work on a project, individually or collaboratively. A few initial topics for free software projects are:

* Favorite photos python tool
* Recipe organizer in python / Meteor
* Code a human-in-the-loop machine-learning gui framework in python
* Code  cool scientific libraries in python (Dynamically Orthogonal Library anyone?)
* Build a strategy game using Meteor (details TBD)
* Make a task management website using Meteor


### How : a set of tools
Each participant is encouraged to bring their own laptop, but you are welcome to share with a friend. No extra laptops will be provided. 

**Programming Tools**: Participants are free to choose the programming language. In general the organizers will help with Python and are interested in learning Meteor/Javascript

**Version Control**: The group will have a github account with various projects.

**Central NoteKeeping**: The github wiki will be used to keep track of topical discussions. The *Docs* project will also be used for living documents such as this *StatementOfPurpose.mkd*

### Why : The purpose
There are many possible purposes to this meeting. The main goal is to foster relationships and conversations within the community around a common interest: "programming." Other purposes could be:


*    sharing tips, techniques, configuration files, tricks, among developers or craftsmen, for self productivity improvement
*    learning-by-using some new version of software, library, method, setup, concept, and with the goal that this knowledge can have an impact on each participant's potential
*    scratching a personal itch. For instance, a topic addresses a need in someone's daily life
*    extending personal network, and  meeting new people
*    improving team-working skills in non-centralized way
*    increasing participant's self confidence for contributing to more open source projects
*    contributing a decent solution to the free software community for common use

### Who : Roles

**Meeting Organizer**: The Meeting Organizer will be responsible for scheduling a room, providing a programming problem, and be availble for light tech support. 

**Sponsors**: When available, a corporate sponsor may provide food and beverages. Sponsors may also have a need that could be addressed by a free software solution, and they may fund this event to help them create a solution that they can use afterwards. However, this coding meeting will not substitute for real-world business development cycles, and may merely use a sponsor's topic as a interesting topic to work on.

**one or more Recorders** Volunteers that take pictures, write blog posts, take videos, publish content, tweets, etc. We hope the meetup content can be helpful to people who can't be physically present. We'd also like to document the fun we are having so that other people can join us.

**Participants** the learners, coders, makers, graphic designers, scripters, sysadmins, etc ...

-------------------
## Guidelines

1. There are no plans after the event ends (i.e. no after-party, no clean-up). Everything should happen during the scheduled time. 
2. No Alcoholic beverages. 
3. Mistakes are allowed. No one knows it all. Sometimes a participant can decide that they know better and then they ruin the ambiance by deciding for others what to do and who does what. This behaviour is not welcome in this context where we want to encourage learning by doing (and making mistakes). 
4. No over-doing it. This is meant to be a safe place to experiment with programming. Participants have to feel no pressure, except the one they chose to put on themselves by choice. That way they do what they really want to, and they do it with heart. If the coding objective fails, it does not matter that much, there are multiple purposes here and the sharing and the learning will have succeeded.
