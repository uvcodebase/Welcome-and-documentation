# UV Codebase
-----------------------------------
##Briefly - What is UV Codebase ?

It's a group gathering around the common purpose of coding (or programming), possibly related to a free software project. There is a focus on sharing tips and tricks, learning by doing, and contributing to the free software community.

---------------------------
##Purpose of this document

This is a set of guidelines to provide structure to meetings and help make sure everyone has fun. The purpose of these meetings are to:

* Provide enjoyable social interactions
* Provide enjoyable activities
* Foster collaborations 
* Provide volunteer opportunities
* Bring together community members around:
    * Free Software
    * Learning to code
    * Learning how to code better
    * Working collaboratively


-------------------------
##Meeting Details

### When : 6pm - 8pm on a weeknight

At least once (likely twice) a month, 6pm - 8pm on a weeknight. 

Check the [Howe library events schedule](http://www.thehowe.org/right.php/pid/2/sid/1) for the exact days, as the day and room may shift depending on availability of meeting places. 

### Where : Howe Library

One of the [Howe library](http://www.thehowe.org) meeting rooms. For the exact location, again check the [Howe library events schedule](http://www.thehowe.org/right.php/pid/2/sid/1).

### What : Activities

Depending on the size of the group, there are multiple potential activities:

* Collaboration on a Free Software Project
* Solving this meeting's programming challenge
* Helping newer programmers get started
* Learning a new tool

The Meeting Organizer will normally be available to help people get set up with a programming environment, and field general questions.

At each meeting, the Organizer will provide a programming challenge question for some participants to work on during the meeting, if they want. At the end of the meeting, the participants who want to compete will have their solutions pitted against everyone else, and a meeting winner will be declared. 

Other meeting attenders can choose to work on a free software project. A few initial topics for projects are:

* Build a strategy game using Meteor (details to be discussed)
* Make a task management website using Meteor
* Code a Dynamical Orthogonality Library in python
* Code a human-in-the-loop machine-learning gui framework in python

### How : a set of tools
Each participant is encouraged to bring their own laptop, but you are welcome to share with a friend. No extra laptops will be provided. 

**Programming Tools**: The programming language, or tools are free to be chosen by the participants. In general the organizers will help with Python and are interested in learning Meteor/Javascript

**Version Control**: The group will have a github account with various projects.

**Central NoteKeeping**: The github wiki will be used to keep track of topical discussions. The *Docs* project will also be used for living documents such as this *StatementOfPurpose.mkd*

### Why : The purpose
There are many possible purposes to this meeting. The main goal is to foster relations within the community around a common interest: "programming." Specifically, the purpose could be:

*    contributing a decent solution to the free software community for common use
*    learning-by-using some new version of some software, library, method, setup, concept, and this knowledge can have an effective impact on each participant potential
*    sharing tips, techniques, configuration files, tricks, among developers or craftsmen, for self productivity improvement
*    scratching personal itch, in some cases, when the topic fits some solution that one can actually really use in his daily life
*    extending personal network, meeting new people, especially for people that are not usually the very social kind
*    perpetuating the hackers culture, fundamental principle that makes the free software community pertinent, vibrant and innovative, without top-down control
*    improving the agility of team-working in non-centralized way, and by that way improving the self confidence for contributing to more open source projects

### Who : Roles

** Meeting Organizer **: The meeting Organizer will be responsible for scheduling a room, providing a programming problem, and be availble for light tech support. 
** Sponsors **: When available, a corporate sponsor may provide food and beverages. Sponsors may also have a need that could be addressed by a free software solution, and they may fund this event to help them create a solution that they can use afterwards. However, this coding meeting will not substitute for real-world business development cycles, and may merely use a sponsor's topic as a interesting topic to work on.
** one or many reporters ** Volunteers that take pictures, write blog posts, take videos, publish content, tweets, social network seeds, about the event. That role is usually chosen by people that don't feel confident for participating in hard core coding but still want to help making it fun and memorable. The visibility on the event has many advantages, for the participant but also for the community at large, as a demonstration of free software liveliness.
** Participants ** the coders and makers, graphic designers, scripters, sysadmins, etc ... well, of course, for doing the real thing, those are most of the participants hopefully.

-------------------
## Guidelines

1. There are no plans after the event ends (i.e. no after-party, or clean-up). Everything should happen during the scheduled time. 
2. No Alcoholic beverages. 
3. Mistakes are allowed. No one knows it all. Sometimes a participant can decide that they know better and ruins the ambiance by deciding for others what to do and who does what. This behaviour is not welcome in this context where we want to encourage learn by doing (and making mistakes). 
4. No over-doing it. This is meant to be a safe place to experiment with programming. Participants have to feel no pressure, except the one they chose to put on themselves by choice. That way they do what they really want to, and they do it with heart. If there is too much strict objective it may fail, or feel like a job, spoil the fun and kill the motivation. If the coding objective fails, it does not matter that much, the purpose is multiple and the sharing and the learning will have succeeded.
