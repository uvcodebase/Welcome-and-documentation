# Welcome
Whether you are a learner who wants a hands-on programming experience or an accomplished coder looking for a collaborative environment, you've come to the right place. The UVcodebase seeks to foster relationships, conversations, and coding within the community. We are currently trying to make this site more useful. Feel free to lend a hand!

# Getting started
Most of the generated documentation is present on the [Wiki](https://github.com/uvcodebase/docs/wiki) of this repository, and in general new documentation can be generated/edited there.  A reasonable place to start is picking something to work on! We have a few [suggestions](https://github.com/uvcodebase/Welcome-and-documentation/wiki/Suggested-Projects) if you don't have a goal that you want to work towards, and the shared project is also a good choice. 

#Shared project
Just want to dive in? Our current shared project is [here](https://github.com/uvcodebase/RecipePlaylist) with some of the setup described [here]([here](https://github.com/uvcodebase/Welcome-and-documentation/wiki/Startup-Email). The [Developer Page](https://github.com/uvcodebase/RecipePlaylist/wiki/Developer) may be a good place to start setting up and IDE and learning how to use `meteor`.

#Demo link
Our demos are fun: https://github.com/uvcodebase/demos 

# Docs
The purpose of this repository is to store general documentation generated by and useful for the group.
For example, the [Statement of Purpose](https://github.com/uvcodebase/docs/blob/master/StatementOfPurpose.md) is located here.
